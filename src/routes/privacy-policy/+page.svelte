      What legal bases do we rely on to process your information?
    </h3>
    <p class=" text-neutral-950 pb-4">
      In short we only process your personal information when we believe it is
      necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so
      under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to
      provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual
      obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business
      interests. If you are located in the eu or uk, this section applies to
      you.
    </p>
    <p class=" text-neutral-950 pb-4">
      The general data protection regulation (gdpr) and uk gdpr require us to
      explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal
      information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process
      your personal information:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-6 my-4">
      <li>
        Consent - we may process your information if you have given us
        permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a
        specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Legitimate interests - we may process your information when we believe
        it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests
        and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental
        rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal
        information for some of the purposes described in order to send users
        information about special offers and discounts on our products and
        services, develop and display personalized and relevant advertising
        content for our users, analyze how our services are used so we can
        improve them to engage and retain users, support our marketing
        activities, diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities,
        understand how our users use our products and services so we can improve
        user experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        Legal obligations - we may process your information where we believe it
        is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to
        cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or
        defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in
        litigation in which we are involved.
      </li>
      <li>
        Vital interests - we may process your information where we believe it is
        necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a
        third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the
        safety of any person. If you are located in canada, this section applies
        to you. We may process your information if you have given us specific
        permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for
        a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be
        inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any
        time. In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under
        applicable law to process your information without your consent,
        including, for example, if collection is clearly in the interests of an
        individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way, for
        investigations and fraud detection and prevention, for business
        transactions provided certain conditions are met, if it is contained in
        a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process,
        or settle an insurance claim, for identifying injured, ill, or deceased
        persons and communicating with next of kin, if we have reasonable
        grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of
        financial abuse, if it is reasonable to expect collection and use with
        consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the
        information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to
        investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of
        canada or a province, if disclosure is required to comply with a
        subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the
        production of records, if it was produced by an individual in the course
        of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is
        consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced • if
        the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary
        purposes, if the information is publicly available and is specified by
