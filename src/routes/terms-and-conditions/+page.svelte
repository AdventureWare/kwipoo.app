    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-color mb-2">Informal Negotiations</h3>
    <p class="text-neutral-950 pb-4">
      Before initiating arbitration, the parties agree to attempt to negotiate any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Legal Terms (“Dispute”) informally for at least thirty (30) days after written notice.
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-color mb-2">Binding Arbitration</h3>
    <p class="text-neutral-950 pb-4">
      If not resolved, the Dispute (except as expressly excluded) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. <strong>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.</strong> Arbitration fees and compensation will be governed by AAA Consumer Rules; if costs are excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses.
    </p>
    <p class="text-neutral-950 pb-4">
      Arbitration may be conducted in person, via documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a written decision and must follow applicable law. Except as required by AAA rules or applicable law, arbitration will take place in Hamilton, Ohio. Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings, or confirm/modify/vacate awards.
    </p>
    <p class="text-neutral-950 pb-4">
      If a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, it shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in Hamilton, Ohio. Parties consent to jurisdiction and waive defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens. Application of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) is excluded. No Dispute may be brought more than one (1) year after the cause of action arose.
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-color mb-2">Restrictions</h3>
    <p class="text-neutral-950 pb-4">
      Arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the parties individually. To the extent permitted by law: (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) no class-action arbitration or class procedures; and (c) no representative capacity claims on behalf of the public or others.
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-color mb-2">Exceptions</h3>
    <p class="text-neutral-950 pb-4">
      The following Disputes are not subject to informal negotiations or binding arbitration: (a) disputes to enforce/protect/validate IP rights; (b) disputes related to theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) claims for injunctive relief. If any part of this section is illegal or unenforceable, such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction as specified above.
